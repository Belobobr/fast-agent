# Workflow

1. start locally in notebook
code should work locally in notebook without databases e.t.c. So we should be able to iterate on core agent without dependencies
```

```
2. create sample dataset (possibly generated)
3. log the model(agent) and evaluation results
we should be able to evaluate models without dependencies
```

```
4. start serving
here we can wrap our agent with rest interface
```

```
7. adjust dataset (manually, subject metter experts e.t.c)
based on the observations update dataset
```

```
5. make updates
8. update code and prompts, log
```
```
6. reavaluate

9. deploy to production
